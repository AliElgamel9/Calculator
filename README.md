# Calculator
The code is ready for use but there is no output message or input information. You can test the calculator from the code itself. 
This calculator has basic type of operators and function names as cos, sin, etc. 
The interesting thing on this calculator is that you can add any new function name like inverse sin or sinh but you should implement a function 
let it's name sinh which take a number and return a result. I hope you like it. I am interesting for your comment or tips :).

# features on progress
