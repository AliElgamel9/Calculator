# Calculator
The code is ready for use but there is no output message or input information. You can test the calculator from the code itself. 
This calculator has basic type of operators and function names as cos, sin, etc. 
The interesting thing on this calculator is that you can add any new function name like inverse sin or sinh but you should implement a function 
let it's name sinh which take a number and return a result. I hope you like it. I am interesting for your comment or tips :).

# Manual

available named functions cos, sin, tan, log, ln, abs and sqr. also you can use Permutations and Combinations the format is the same as in math nCr and nPr

1) log(num) 
2) lognum(num) 
3) log[num](num)

# features on progress
detect the math error index and the type of the error. these features are still in progress so don't try to use them yet. They will give you meaningless information
